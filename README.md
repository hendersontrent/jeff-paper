# jeff-paper
Analysis and modelling for a collaboration paper titled "Physiological fractals: Visual and statistical evidence across timescales and experimental states" between Jeffrey Kim, Stacey Parker, Trent Henderson, and James Kirby. This paper is currently under review at Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

## Motivation

To understand from a time series perspective how rest vs meditation HR-HRV differs at T1 vs T2 and whether this can explain other preliminary findings in the paper.

## Intended outputs

Analysis and plots describing time series features of the data.
